**Abstract:** CellProfiler has enabled the scientific research community to create flexible, modular image analysis pipelines since its release in 2005. Here, we describe CellProfiler 3.0, a new version of the software supporting both whole-volume and plane-wise analysis of three-dimensional (3D) image stacks, increasingly common in biomedical research. CellProfilerâ€™s infrastructure is greatly improved, and we provide a protocol for cloud-based large-scale image processing. New plugins enable running pre-trained deep learning models on images. Designed by and for biologists, CellProfiler equips researchers with powerful computational tools via a well-documented user interface, empowering biologists in all fields to create quantitative, reproducible image analysis workflows.

All pipelines were initially designed to run in CellProfiler 3.0.0; all FIJI macros in FIJI-ImageJ1.51N with MorpholibJ 1.3.3.
